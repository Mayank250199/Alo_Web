				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment &#8211; we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. You may be a doctor. But I&#8217;m the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I&#8217;m saving the world? Well Kangs, I must say, there&#8217;s no place like home&#8230; and this is no place like home. I&#8217;d call you a genius, except I&#8217;m in the room. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime.</p>
<p>Then, all things considered&#8230;it&#8217;s time I grew up. That&#8217;s the trouble with regeneration. You quite never know what you&#8217;re going to get. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.</p>

<p>I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part. Allow me to congratulate you, sir. You have the most totally closed mind that I&#8217;ve ever encountered. The past is another country. 1987&#8217;s just the Isle of Wight. You may disguise your features but you can never disguise your intent. New-new-Doctor. There&#8217;s always something to look at if you open your eyes! Oh, my giddy aunt! Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there&#8217;s a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us.</p>
<p>Nine hundred years of time and space, and I&#8217;ve never been slapped by someone&#8217;s mother. Well, you&#8217;re very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn&#8217;t have to end. I hate endings! The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. We all have a universe of our own terrors to face. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. It may be irrational of me, but human beings are my favorite species.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nice to meet you, Rose. Sorry, I&#8217;m going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment &#8211; we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime.

<p>Good grief&#8230;. It&#8217;s a Stegosaurus! Renewed? Have I? That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;ve been renewed. It&#8217;s part of the TARDIS. Without it I couldn&#8217;t survive. Doctor no more. Oh, my giddy aunt! New-new-Doctor. You look beautiful! &#8230;considering. That you&#8217;re human. I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;d probably blame the English. Eh? Doctor who? What&#8217;s he talking about…? Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about? Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for. Why is there never a big red button? Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched only by its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself.</p>
<p>Butterfingers. Shall we ask for a better quality of door so we can escape? Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves. I&#8217;m a Doctor… though probably not the one that you were expecting Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. Let&#8217;s go in! You may disguise your features but you can never disguise your intent. My dear Miss Shaw, I never report myself anywhere, particularly not forthwith. I can&#8217;t stand burnt toast. I loathe bus stations. Terrible places. Full of lost luggage and lost souls.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway. Good grief&#8230;. It&#8217;s a Stegosaurus! Our lives are different from anybody else’s. That’s the exciting thing. Nobody in the universe can do what we’re doing. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They&#8217;re all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-256" src="http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/18215144661813.5819e2470b849-1024x688-1024x688.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="688" srcset="http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/18215144661813.5819e2470b849-1024x688.jpg 1024w, http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/18215144661813.5819e2470b849-1024x688-300x202.jpg 300w, http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/18215144661813.5819e2470b849-1024x688-768x516.jpg 768w, http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/18215144661813.5819e2470b849-1024x688-700x470.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Yes? What is it? What do you want? There&#8217;s something that doesn&#8217;t make sense. Let&#8217;s go and poke it with a stick. You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up &#8216;genocide&#8217;. You&#8217;ll find a little picture of me there, and the caption&#8217;ll read &#8216;Over my dead body&#8217;. You know Jo, I sometimes think that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms. Have a jelly baby. New-new-Doctor. The thing is, Adam, time travel is like visiting Paris. You can&#8217;t just read the guidebook, you&#8217;ve got to throw yourself in! Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers! Or is that just me?</p>
<p>People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back. Until then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward in all your beliefs and prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine. Goodbye Susan. Goodbye my dear. Think about me when you&#8217;re living your life one day after another, all in a neat pattern. Think about the homeless traveller and his old police box, with his days like crazy paving.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Timing malfunction. The Master! He&#8217;s out there. I&#8217;ve got to stop&#8230; him&#8230; Then, all things considered&#8230;it&#8217;s time I grew up. Physician, heal thyself. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! You don&#8217;t understand so you find excuses. &#8216;Timey&#8217; what? &#8216;Timey wimey&#8217;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I&#8217;m wearing a vegetable! I might&#8217;ve been saying something important. I was saying something important! Adric? I&#8217;m a Doctor… though probably not the one that you were expecting The world&#8217;s about to end, and here I am, stuck in traffic. I think I might have miscalculated. Your ideas are too narrow and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot. Mmmm… what&#8217;s that m&#8217;boy? I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-339" src="http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/24e75448444537.58989725da9f0-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="672" srcset="http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/24e75448444537.58989725da9f0-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/24e75448444537.58989725da9f0-1-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/24e75448444537.58989725da9f0-1-525x700.jpg 525w, http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/24e75448444537.58989725da9f0-1-975x1300.jpg 975w, http://www.subsolardesigns.com/vivian/demo2/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/24e75448444537.58989725da9f0-1.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /></p>
<p>[The Hand of Omega] is called that because Time Lords have an infinite capacity for pretension. I don&#8217;t suppose we&#8217;ll ever know if we actually succeeded. But at worst, we failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong. Don&#8217;t be lasagna. You’ll never understand. I want to see the universe, not to rule it. Not allowed? Not allowed? Me, I’m allowed everywhere. Pure mathematics can not lie! The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense.</p>
<p>Anybody remotely interesting is mad in some way. Excellent. Blow up that vehicle. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. Do you wanna come with me? &#8216;Cause if you do, then I should warn you — you&#8217;re gonna see all sorts of things. Ghosts from the past. Aliens from the future. The day the Earth died in a ball of flame. It won&#8217;t be quiet, it won&#8217;t be safe, and it won&#8217;t be calm. But I&#8217;ll tell you what it will be: The trip of a lifetime! Goodbye&#8230; Fancypants! Go and be the Doctor that I could never be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No, not the hugging. I&#8217;m against the hugging. People who talk about infallibility are usually on very shaky ground. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it&#8217;s a plan. I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them. We&#8217;re trying to defeat the Daleks, not start a jumble sale! Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those. You cannot rewrite history! Not one line! Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. The thing is, Adam, time travel is like visiting Paris. You can&#8217;t just read the guidebook, you&#8217;ve got to throw yourself in! Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers! Or is that just me?</p>

<p>Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there&#8217;s a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. Then, all things considered&#8230;it&#8217;s time I grew up. Old ladies die all the time. It&#8217;s practically in the job description. Run. Nice to meet you, Rose. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought. Life depends on change and renewal. Underneath it all I think you&#8217;re probably kind and nice, and very brave. I just wish you weren&#8217;t a soldier.</p>
<p>Are these antiques dotted about all over the building? It really is a splendid piece of audioarchitectonicalmetrasynchosity! There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought. Sorry, must dash! Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn&#8217;t it? Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don&#8217;t tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother!</p>

<p>Are these antiques dotted about all over the building? It really is a splendid piece of audioarchitectonicalmetrasynchosity! There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought. Sorry, must dash! Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn&#8217;t it? Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don&#8217;t tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother!</p>
<p>My ship…my TARDIS… I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought. No sir. Thirteen! Are you taller? Why? Do you have to reach a high shelf? t&#8217;s called the TARDIS, this thing. T-A-R-D-I-S. That&#8217;s Time And Relative Dimension In Space. That’s okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Then, all things considered&#8230;it&#8217;s time I grew up. That&#8217;s the trouble with regeneration. You quite never know what you&#8217;re going to get. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought. The least important things, sometimes my dear boy, lead to the greatest discoveries. The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment &#8211; we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel.</p>

<p>Nine hundred years of time and space, and I&#8217;ve never been slapped by someone&#8217;s mother. Well, you&#8217;re very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn&#8217;t have to end. I hate endings! The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. We all have a universe of our own terrors to face. No. That is not the question. That is not where we start. It may be irrational of me, but human beings are my favorite species.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definite article, you might say. Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I&#8217;m saving the world? Well Kangs, I must say, there&#8217;s no place like home&#8230; and this is no place like home. I&#8217;d call you a genius, except I&#8217;m in the room. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. Then, all things considered&#8230;it&#8217;s time I grew up. That&#8217;s the trouble with regeneration. You quite never know what you&#8217;re going to get. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.</p>

<p>I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part. Allow me to congratulate you, sir. You have the most totally closed mind that I&#8217;ve ever encountered. The past is another country. 1987&#8217;s just the Isle of Wight. You may disguise your features but you can never disguise your intent. New-new-Doctor. There&#8217;s always something to look at if you open your eyes! Oh, my giddy aunt! Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there&#8217;s a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us.</p>
